                <div id="uldiv">
                    <ul>
                        <li>The main concept of a network of smart devices was discussed as early as 1982, with a modified Coca-Cola vending
                            machine
                            at Carnegie Mellon University becoming the first ARPANET-connected appliance,able to report its inventory and
                            whether
                            newly loaded drinks were cold or not</li>
                        <li>Mark Weiser's 1991 paper on ubiquitous computing, "The Computer of the 21st Century", as well as academic venues
                            such as
                            UbiComp and PerCom produced the contemporary vision of the IOT.</li>
                        <li>Between 1993 and 1997, several companies proposed solutions like Microsoft's at Work or Novell's NEST. The field
                            gained
                            momentum when Bill Joy envisioned device-to-device communication as a part of his "Six Webs" framework,
                            presented at the
                            World Economic Forum at Davos in 1999.</li>
                        <li>
                            Defining the Internet of things as "simply the point in time when more 'things or objects' were connected to the
                            Internet than people", Cisco Systems estimated that the IoT was "born" between 2008 and 2009, with the things/people
                            ratio growing from 0.08 in 2003 to 1.84 in 2010.
                        </li>

                    <h2>Remote Monitoring</h2>
                    <p>
                        Monitor almost any kind of asset—including heavy machinery, vehicles, and even livestock—almost anywhere, either
                        continuously or at regular intervals. By tracking location, performance, condition, or environmental factors, the
                        insights you gain from IoT-connected things may help you:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reduce your service costs and refine your business processes.</li>
                        <li>Understand how your products are performing to provide a better experience for your customers.</li>
                        <li>Increase the number of appointments per day, cut fuel costs, and reduce wear-and-tear by using machine learning
                            capabilities to route freight or vehicles more efficiently.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Know where your resources are at any given moment—down to which vehicle they’re on—for improved field service, stronger
                    security, and increased employee safety.

                    <h2>Predictive Maintenance</h2>
                    <p>
                    Similar to remote monitoring, predictive maintenance incorporates machine learning software that analyzes data to
                    predict outcomes and automate actions. Predictive capabilities allow service providers to move beyond the traditional
                    reactive and scheduled maintenance business model and use their data to identify issues before they become critical.
                    This gives technicians the opportunity to intervene before customers even realize there's a problem. Armed with this
                    information, you're able to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Figure out what mechanical or operational conditions are causing failures or slowdowns.</li>
                        <li>Better predict what spare parts to keep in your inventory before repair issues arise.</li>
                        <li>Move beyond a break/fix business model by preventing equipment failures through preventative maintenance.</li>
                    </ul>

                    energy efficiency, space utilization, productivity, and safety using the data you collect. The insights you gain may
                    help you:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Save money by automating lighting or optimizing heating and cooling cycles.</li>
                        <li>Increase employee or occupant satisfaction by keep equipment running or ensuring that supplies are stocked.</li>

                    <p>
                    What is the internet of things used for in manufacturing? Every business is different, but many manufacturing processes
                    share a common pathway from raw materials to finished products. With IoT, it's possible to learn from your own systems
                    find new ways to manage your processes and product quality with data from your devices and sensors. With these data
                    insights, you're able to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identify bottlenecks that reduce efficiency, enabling you to improve your process.</li>
                        <li>Reduce downtime caused by unplanned maintenance or equipment failure.</li>
                        <li>Eliminate substandard materials, parts, or errors before your product is complete.</li>
                        <li>Improve materials and inventory management so that you always have what you need on hand.</li>
                    </ul>

                    Connected products have smart, connective components that allow data to be exchanged between the product and its user,
                    manufacturer, or environment. Related IoT solutions may help you build smart factories with new functionality, greater
                    reliability, and higher product utilization. Using connected products, you're able to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Streamline the development and maintenance of your products.</li>
                        <li>Provide more secure, connected experiences for your customers.</li>
                        <li>Create new lines of business with managed service and support.</li>
                        <li>Monitor how products perform to improve design, manufacturing, and reliability.</li>
